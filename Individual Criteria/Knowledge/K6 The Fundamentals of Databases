# Assignment Brief: K6 – The Fundamentals of Data Structures, Database System Design, Implementation and Maintenance

## Title  
**Understanding and Applying Data Structures and Database Design in a Business Environment**

---

## Aim  
To demonstrate your understanding of how data is stored, structured, and maintained within your organisation. This includes knowledge of different data structures, how databases are designed and implemented, and how data is kept accurate, reliable, and secure.

You must present your work in the form of a **professional report** based on your job role, team, or department. Use real examples where possible, and realistic work-based scenarios where needed.

## Learning Outcome – K6  
**Understand the fundamentals of data structures, database system design, implementation and maintenance.**

## What You Must Cover

Your report must show your understanding of data structures, database design, and data maintenance. This should reflect how these are used (or could be used) in your work environment.

- ✅ Use **real examples from your job** wherever possible.
- ✅ If something is not part of your current role, describe **a realistic workplace scenario** where it could be applied.

For example:
- If you don’t currently use queues, explain how they *could* be used to manage training requests or support tickets.
- If you’re not involved in database backups, describe how your organisation’s IT or systems team might handle them in line with best practice.

## Report Format

This must be presented as a **structured business report**. Use professional language, clear headings, and include visuals or tables where useful.

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. Introduction** | Explain the importance of data structures and database design in your organisation. State the purpose of your report. |
| **2. Data Structures** | Use subheadings (e.g. `2.1 Arrays`). For each type: describe what it is, when it’s used, and relate it to your role or a realistic business scenario. |
| **3. Database Design and Implementation** | Describe how databases are built and managed in your organisation. Include:<br> - Table structures and foreign keys<br> - Choosing correct data types<br> - Risks from anomalies and how normalisation helps<br> - Diagrams such as an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), if relevant |
| **4. Database Maintenance** | Explain how data is kept clean, secure, and backed up in your workplace. Give examples of data errors, how they are corrected, and how recovery is handled. |
| **5. Conclusion** | Summarise the impact of good data design and maintenance on business performance, decision-making, and data accuracy. |
